# Progress week one

- Choosing the project subject
- Created skeleton for project
- Version control setup
- Planning for libraries and project structure

Most of the time this week was used trying to decide what subject to choose for the project. After the decision it was time to try and understand on the larger scale how to implement
a chess game and secondly how to implement the bot to play against. These are still somewhat questions in the air, but this is mostly just a problem with lack of research.
This is partly, because I was going for completely different subject for the project, but after doing research for it, it didn't feel right so the subject changed.

Time: 6h

## Next week
First step is to do more research about the topic on how to implement the chess game, and after that second step is to start to code the frame for the project.
