# Progress week five
Goal for this week was to get minimax-algorithm working, which is the case, but just barely. Needed a lot of refactoring and thinking to get it going, but gladly code is decently
written at this point, so it is relatively easy to do. Project is otherwise pretty much done, only thing is to get the most difficult part of the project finished.
I was stuck many times this week, first on checkmate logic and second on how to feed data for minimax. At this point the algorithm at least gives out something which is a win,
although half of the time it is nonsense.

## Next week
Go big or go home. Result next week is either a beatiful chess game, or a miserable fail. Logic wise everything should be pretty much done, so next week is all about getting
minimax with alpha pruning working effectively.
