# Progress week two

- More in depth planning for project structure and libraries
- Getting to know ins and outs of react-chessboard
- Testing setup
- First steps for chess piece movements
- Score system
- Tests

Maybe one third of the total time spent was spent on getting familiar with the react-chessboard library, which is used to render the chessboard.
After react-chessboard was tackled to a point, first line of codes were written and basic testing structure was put in place.
Most of the time was spent on studying and configuring project files and testing setup. 

Time: 15h

## Next week
Hopefully no big problems emerge and most of the time can be spent on coding and writing tests. In best case scenario movement and logic for all chess pieces is done next week.
