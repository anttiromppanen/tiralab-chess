# Progress week three

Plan for this week was to have all of the chess piece movement logic down, but this fall short of two pieces. However this isn't a big deal, because effort was put into
refactoring and simplifying the overall logic around chess pieces, which makes developing the rest of the logic much easier task. This week was all about coding, testing, refactoring,
and a little bit of studying about how to implement the upcoming algorithms on opponent chess AI.

## Next week

First task of next week is to finish the final chess piece movements, and start on the general game logic. At this point the player can move some of the pieces, but the game
itself does not have any logic, which is not optimal for a chess game.
