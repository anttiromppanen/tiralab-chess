# Progress week four
Plan was to have initial minimax algorithm ready this week, but due to some bugs and need for refactoring the code and data structures this was postponed.
Building a chess engine from scratch with limited chess experience is a lot of work, but it is starting to shape up. Some parts of the project needed to be rewritten,
because it wasn't clear in the beginning how things should be properly done. As of now noticed and fixed a game breaking bug, and noticed a bug on checkmate.

## Next week
Firstly bugs need to be fixed, and after should be ready for at least minimax algorithm, maybe with alpha beta pruning included.
